# Go Project Template

## Introduction

We are looking for engineers who can build web services which are simple, stable and secure and who have the user in mind. To test these requirements, we will let you extend this little demo project in our interview process via a live coding session.

As preparation to this call please <b>clone and run the project locally</b> and get familiar with the code structure and how things work. In the interview you will then screenshare your code editor and we will give you a little coding task and you guide us through your decision-making process and code style.

The purpose of this little exercise is to learn more about your architectural thinking, what matters most for you during development and how you communicate with your peers if issues do occur.

We do NOT test how fast you can type or how many syntax errors you do ðŸ˜Š - so please see it more as peer programming.

## Development

### Dependencies

The development setup depends on the following tools:

- go
- docker
- docker-compose
- golint

### Operations

Make provides a interface to common development operations

- `make test-local` spins up a testing environment and executes the tests



##  Some Hints
During your coding, always remind youself of developing simple, stable and secure software.

1. all functionality should be covered by unit and integration tests
2. errors should be handled including 401s, 404s and 500s
3. donâ€™t forget code comments and logging
4. code as simple / easy to read and functional / modular as possible
5. it is okay to ask questions or ask for feedback
5. HAVE FUN!!!
