A flexible template that allows the quick starting of one or more new golang APIs, processing units or microservices.

Currently it is wired to start a single service

File structure: 

- ./ -> where the main file lives
- config -> package which has the role of loading the starting config

- internal -> clearly defined internal packages and adapters for other services
- schema -> migrations for the used databases
- services -> the servers and it's dependent services. one cmd main file starts one of the services
